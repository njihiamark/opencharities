When I was working on open charities, I saw that content could be grouped into
three regions; header, content and footer.

I then wrote css rules to hold the data blocks sectionGray and sectionWhite, if a user wants a white background block they use sectionWhite and if they want a grey background they use sectionGray. 

I also created grid classes just incase the user intends to divide content. These
classes are one-third,one-quater and one-half.

For button styles, I created two one for ghost buttons(class btn-blue-ghost) and one for normal buttons (class btn-blue). I also ensured that the buttons were flat as per the mockup.

There are classes for highligting text too, the class, color-blue, makes text blue and the class, bold makes text bold.

To make the site responsive, I gave the grid classes 100% width just like twitter bootstrap team does.

The carousel in our members section uses Owl carousel. 

The social media icons are font-awesome icons.
